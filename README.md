# Lost Reef - VR
Lost Reef is an interactive VR experience developed for the Oculus Quest 2, where the user swims through a reef as it slowly degrades around them. The purpose of the experience is to show the impact of man-made pollution on reef systems, and the medium of Virtual Reality allows the experience to feel very personal. The experience was initially for a university assessment, and later refined to make the experience feel more alive and iron out the issues.



## Installation (currently needs git lfs)
To run the application, an up-to-date version of Unity is required, as well as a Virtual Reality headset (tested on Oculus Quest 2).
1. Download the repo locally.
2. Run as a Unity project.
3. Build to VR headset (or alternatively build locally and sideload).

The application is optimized for wireless play on an Oculus Quest, however may run smoother if run off of a computer.



## Further Development
- Expand reef level environment
- Improve UI
- Add nuanced interactions
